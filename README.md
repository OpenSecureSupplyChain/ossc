# ossc

## What is OSSC?

This org is a central place for individuals to collaborate and construct
secure supply chain reference architecture(s) by utilising exiting
oss tooling and projects.

We are not seeking to be a standard, specification, foundation, consortium etc

Many of us are already active in various communities with the CNCF, sigstore
and more.

Expect to find mostly documentation and issues utilised as a medium for
collaboration.
